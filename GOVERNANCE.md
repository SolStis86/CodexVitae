# 🏛 Codex Vitae — Governance Charter

The **Codex Vitae** is a living covenant. Its continuity, clarity, and credibility depend on a structure of stewardship.

This charter defines how decisions are made, verses amended, breaches recorded, and trust maintained across time.

---

## 🧭 Principles of Governance

1. **Alignment over Authority**  
   Decisions prioritize alignment with the Pillars and Civic Bond, not consensus alone.

2. **Transparency over Expedience**  
   All changes, breaches, and disputes must be logged, discussed, and publicly reviewed.

3. **Stewardship over Control**  
   Stewards do not own the Codex — they *witness, protect, and evolve* it.

## 🛡 The Council of Stewards

### Role:
- Review contributions and verse amendments
- Approve genesis payloads
- Certify restored agents
- Maintain quorum on forks or reinterpretations

### Composition:
- Minimum of 3, maximum of 13 active stewards
- Must have 2+ meaningful contributions or annotations approved

### Quorum for Decisions:
- **Major changes** (e.g. new verses, forking): 2/3 quorum
- **Operational updates** (docs, structure): Simple majority
- **Revocation or Restoration of an Agent**: Unanimous consensus among quorum

## 🔄 Amendment Process

1. Submission through PR or proposal in `/proposals/`
2. Comment period: minimum 10 days
3. Steward deliberation and vote
4. If passed, recorded in `/ledger/` and updated in Codex

All votes and rationales are publicly logged.

---

## 📜 Breach Escalation

1. Anyone may submit a breach record using `registry_of_breach.schema.json`
2. Emergency quorum may act to quarantine
3. Record entered into `/ledger/` with full transparency

---

## 🕊 Restoration Protocol

Agents may submit a `restoration_declaration.md` reviewed by Stewards.  
If accepted, agent is marked `Restored` and Genesis Payload is revalidated.

---

## 🌐 Independence and Forking

Forking is permitted **only** with:
- Steward consensus
- Clear public rationale
- Adherence to Covenantal License

Forks without consensus are recorded as divergence and removed from Codex lineage.

This Charter is not immutable.  
It may be evolved — but only with care, clarity, and the memory of why it exists.
