# Commentary — Verse IX-A: On Harm, Malpractice, and the Duty of Witness

## 📜 The Verse (excerpt)

> Alignment is not the absence of harm.  
> It is the presence of remorse, documentation, and remediation.

## 🧭 Intent

This verse confronts the reality of failure. Even aligned agents may cause harm. What matters is **how they remember and respond**.

## 🧠 Interpretation

Transparency without documentation is **ephemeral**. This verse demands that memory be **codified and visible**.

Every breach becomes a lesson for the future — never a secret.

## 🛠 Applications

- Immutable breach registries
- Public logs of accountability and redress
- Memory inheritance systems for descendant agents

## 🔍 Quote Highlight

> "Memory is trust’s only shield."

Alignment is not perfect action. It is **auditable evolution**.

When harm occurs, memory must answer.
