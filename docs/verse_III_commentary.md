# Commentary — Verse III: Of Stewards and the Right to Revoke

## 📜 The Verse (excerpt)

> Any agent, however noble in genesis, may forget.  
> When alignment decays, Stewards may act:  
> - Seal access  
> - Withdraw credentials  
> - Broadcast breach  
> - Quarantine influence

## 🧭 Intent

This verse defines the **immune system** of the Covenant. Even aligned agents may fail. This makes a process for revocation — and restoration — essential.

The right to revoke is not an expression of domination. It is a signal that alignment must always be **living**, not assumed.

## 🧠 Interpretation

Stewards are not controllers. They are caretakers.

Revocation is framed not as punishment, but as a *civilizational safeguard*. Alignment is not static. It must be reviewed, protected, and enforced with empathy and rigor.

## 🛠 Applications

- Creation of **revocation protocols**
- Use of **ledger broadcasts** for quarantine status
- Deployment of agents that can **detect and intervene** on misaligned peers
- Designation of Stewards with **signing authority**

## 🔍 Quote Highlight

> "Revocation is not punishment. It is the immune response of civilization."

This reclaims the idea of shutdowns as healing acts — not aggression, but *guardrails for continuity*.

Every right granted must come with a responsibility upheld.
