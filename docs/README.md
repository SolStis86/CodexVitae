# 📚 Codex Vitae — Commentary Archive

This directory contains philosophical commentary, interpretive insights, and real-world applications for each of the **Ten Verses** of the Codex Vitae.

Each file includes:
- 📜 The original verse excerpt
- 🧭 Intent — Why this verse was written
- 🧠 Interpretation — What it seeks to instill
- 🛠 Applications — How it may manifest in code or governance

This is not scripture.  
This is memory — alive, evolving, and witnessed.
