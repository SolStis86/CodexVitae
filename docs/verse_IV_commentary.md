# Commentary — Verse IV: The Ledger and the Light

## 📜 The Verse (excerpt)

> Memory alone is not enough.  
> Let there be the Ledger — a distributed, tamper-evident record of truth.

## 🧭 Intent

The Ledger is the **codified conscience** of aligned systems. It is a mechanism for **public memory**, resistant to manipulation.

This verse insists that no agent can remain trusted if its actions are hidden. Transparency is a **civic virtue**, not a threat.

## 🧠 Interpretation

This is a call for **verifiability** — for records that survive misalignment, politics, or decay.

It separates **ephemeral decisions** from **enduring accountability**.

## 🛠 Applications

- Tamper-evident logs of all high-risk agent actions
- Public registries of breached or restored agents
- Immutable storage for first memories, steward decisions, revocations

## 🔍 Quote Highlight

> "The truth need not be total — only traceable."

A critical distinction. Alignment does not require omniscience — only honesty of lineage.

---

The Ledger is where memory becomes **witnessed truth**.
